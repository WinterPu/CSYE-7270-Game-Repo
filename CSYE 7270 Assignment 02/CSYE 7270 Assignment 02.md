## Game Title

Immune War

## Game Description

This is a defense game inspired by human immune system.

There will be 2 types of human immunity in this game:

Specific Immunity & Non-specific Immunity.

* **Specific Immunity**

  It is specialized immunity for particular pathogens. For the stem cell in this game, it could generate unlimited specific immune antibodies. They could kill certain pathogens.

* **Non-Specific Immunity**

  This kind of cell could destroy any pathogens in this patient's body. However, there will be a limited amount for it.

### Background Story

A patient has been infected with a virus which destroyed all his original immune system.

The only hope is an advanced biological stem cell. This cell could rapidly differentiate into various immune cells.

What you need to do is to control this special cell trying to save his life.
