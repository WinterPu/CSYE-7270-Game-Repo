## Course Project Discussion

* Is it OK to show videos of your game to future classes?

  **Yes**

* Is the scope enough for a semesters work? Is the scope is appropriate for the number of people in the group and it being a semester project?

  **Yes, I think so.**

  This project involved the following fields which are covered in our class.

  * Unity Game Basics
  * Animation
  * Sound
  * AI Path Finding
  * Particle Effect

  I also add like Health Live Count Control System and Loot System into this game.

  **For The Future Work**

  I think I could 

  * Clean the code

  * Add more boss attack ways

  * Enhance the weapons and weapon switch system

  * Expend to multi-levels
